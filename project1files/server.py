# CITS3002 2021 Assignment
#
# This file implements a basic server that allows a single client to play a
# single game with no other participants, and very little error checking.
#
# Any other clients that connect during this time will need to wait for the
# first client's game to complete.
#
# Your task will be to write a new server that adds all connected clients into
# a pool of players. When enough players are available (two or more), the server
# will create a game with a random sample of those players (no more than
# tiles.PLAYER_LIMIT players will be in any one game). Players will take turns
# in an order determined by the server, continuing until the game is finished
# (there are less than two players remaining). When the game is finished, if
# there are enough players available the server will start a new game with a
# new selection of clients.
